# Slack team per user

## Overview
This endpoint is very similar to the regular [Slack endpoint](https://slingr-stack.github.io/platform/endpoints_slack.html). The main differences is that with this endpoint each user can connect to a different team and it doesnâ€™t support the Real Time Messaging API. The rest of the features are exactly the same:
- Shortcuts for web API
- Interactive messages
- Slash commands
- Events API
- Conversations

For more information please refer to [docs](https://slingr-stack.github.io/platform/endpoints_slack_user.html).
